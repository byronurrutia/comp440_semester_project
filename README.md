 # COMP 440 Semester Project
 
 ## Project High Level Description

In the project, you would be required to create a project in the format of a Vanilla script (a SQL file that creates database objects with the schema in the third normal form), that will include tables, foreign keys, indexes, views, and stored procedures. I will ask you to insert data into it. You may use tools besides SSMS to insert data.

The description will evolve and will include the acceptance criteria and a simple grading matrix.

Here please find the original specification for the MODEL upon which to build the Schema ( collection of tables and keys).

## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Any software product, besides high-level description, is defined in terms of features.
These features evolve along with the business. They can be added, upgraded, and deprecated.
A current version of the product will have a current set of features (usually described in a manual).
As business/product evolves, new features appear and current may change. In order to deliver these new features to a customer, developers develop the features and then deploy/release them on certain defined and declared schedule.
The scope for the upcoming release, thus, includes a set of features. After we release, the product is in the maintenance mode. The users can find bugs.
they can file tickets about these bugs or can have suggestions.
Product managers insert these prioritized features into the product log along with the datetime reported, categories (bug, improvement, or new feature), and ticket number.
We will be developing a release management system schema / database based on the description above.
I am only interested in product evolution schema: Product, Version, Release (with notes), Features, Bugs, Enhancements.
No people, roles, or development process/ environment.
